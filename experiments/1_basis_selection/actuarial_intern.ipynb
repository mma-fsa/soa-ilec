      "- Calendar-period mismatch in improvement: US mortality improvement slowed/stalled after the Great Recession (and varied by cause of death), while many generic MI scales assume steadier improvements. If MI reduces expected rates too aggressively in more recent years, A/E >1.00 appears in segments with less real-world improvement.\n",
      "- Class- and selection-specific improvement: Preferred underwriting cohorts often have different improvement patterns than standard/other classes. A single MI scale by age/sex/smoker might not reflect class-specific dynamics, producing A/E <1.00 in class 1 and >1.00 in classes 2–4.\n",
      "- Product and guarantee structure: Lapse, conversion, and guarantee features drive selection and duration mix that MI scales don’t directly capture. For example, post-level-term effects or secondary guarantees can change the attained-age mix and risk quality year over year.\n",
      "- Age-shape of improvement: MI scales may overstate improvement at young/middle ages (raising A/E) and understate at the oldest ages (lowering A/E), or vice-versa. The trees show younger non-best classes often >1.00, oldest ages often <1.00.\n",
      "- Portfolio-specific mix shifts: Changes in distribution, underwriting, reinsurance, or face-amount mix over time can deviate from the general population/industry assumptions underlying MI scales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendations and next steps\n",
      "- Calibrate basis by plan and class: Apply plan-level A/E scalars, and consider class-specific adjustments; for MI, allow different improvement dampening by preferred class and age.\n",
      "- Add a calendar-year slope: Where the year split is dominant (e.g., Other), fit a simple trend to scale expectations by observation year.\n",
      "- Cap or taper MI at older ages: Given very low A/E at 90+, consider capping MI at advanced ages or blending to ultimate improvements.\n",
      "- Credibility filter: Some extreme node A/Es are sparse. If you’d like, I can re-run with a minimum expected threshold per node or deliver a CSV with A/E by node and expected exposure so you can apply your own credibility cutoffs.\n",
      "- If you want to focus on 2015 VBT vs 2015 VBT w/ MI only, I can run paired trees per plan and directly compare node-by-node A/E to flag segments where MI helps or hurts the most.\n"

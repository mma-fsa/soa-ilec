      "Running request...\n",
      "Yes — you’ve done the right core work (per-year A/E and a sensible set of bins). A few additional technical, statistical and practical considerations will improve the robustness and implementability of the final issue-year → basis decision. Below I list what to think about, why it matters, and concrete actions/tests you can run next.\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Use exposure and credibility, not just dollar A/E\n",
      "- Why: tiny years (low expected $ or few claims) can have very noisy A/E; choosing a basis based solely on a single-year AE risks overfitting.\n",
      "- Action: compute expected-dollar and claim-count exposures by year. Require a minimum exposure (e.g., Expected >= $X or Claims >= N) to accept a per-year override; otherwise pool with neighbors. Compute credibility weights (e.g., z = Expected / (Expected + k)) and shrink year-level AE toward the default basis using credibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Look at count-based A/E and by-number vs by-amount\n",
      "- Why: bases were compared by amount only. If claim frequency differs from size distortions (e.g., a few large claims), amount-AE can be misleading.\n",
      "- Action: compute AE by claim count (Actual count / Expected count if you have an expected-count column or derive by dividing amount-based expected by average face or using another proxy), and compare. Consider a composite criterion (both amount and count must prefer a basis).\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Inspect distributions by plan, age at issue, attained age, face size, smoker/sex/underwriting class\n",
      "- Why: a basis may look good at aggregate issue-year level but perform poorly in certain subpopulations that matter for reserving/pricing.\n",
      "- Action: for each candidate bin/year, run plan-level and age-band A/E checks. If an issue-year’s “best basis” produces large, systematic residuals for a major plan or age band, don’t use it without plan-level calibration.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Account for policy duration / selection and lapse\n",
      "- Why: mortality selection varies by duration; older bases may implicitly assume different selection patterns. Issue-year mixes durations — comparing raw amounts could be confounded.\n",
      "- Action: test AE by policy duration (select years like 1–5, 6–15, 15+) or include duration as a regressand. Consider basing selection on earned exposure (policy years) rather than only issue-year.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Use statistical tests and residual diagnostics\n",
      "- Why: AE difference might be within sampling noise.\n",
      "- Action: compute Pearson residuals, standardized residuals, confidence intervals (bootstrap or delta method) for AE by year. Only override if difference is statistically meaningful or materially large.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Prefer smoothness / continuity across adjacent years\n",
      "- Why: operationally you want monotone/smooth mapping; avoid jumping bases year-to-year for adjacent years unless justified.\n",
      "- Action: apply smoothing (rolling-window AE), or require that a candidate basis be better than default for at least two adjacent years before switching. Consider run-length penalties.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) Choose selection rule that balances global and local fit\n",
      "- Why: QX2015 gives best global AE but QX7580E gives better plan-level error metrics. Your objective (aggregate accuracy vs distributional fit) matters.\n",
      "- Action: define an objective function (e.g., weighted sum: w_total * |AE_total-1| + w_plan * WAPE + w_smooth * year-change penalty) and pick basis per year that minimizes it. You can tune weights to business goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) Consider multiplicative calibration vs basis switching\n",
      "- Why: a simple scale factor per bin preserves the relative shape of the chosen basis but fixes totals.\n",
      "- Action: for each bin, compute scale = Actual / Expected. Consider applying multiplicative calibrations to QX2015 for many bins and only switching basis for bins where an alternate basis materially improves plan-level residuals (after calibration).\n",
      "\n",
      "9) Credible aggregation strategies for sparse early years\n",
      "- Why: 1906–1924 is noisy.\n",
      "- Action: either group early years into a legacy bin (you already did) or do empirical Bayes shrinkage where per-year selection is blended with a pooled prior.\n",
      "\n",
      "10) Watch for confounders and model mismatch\n",
      "- Why: changes in underwriting, product definitions, claim reporting, medical advances, or legal/regulatory changes can create cohort effects that match one basis only coincidentally.\n",
      "- Action: document known product changes or underwriting rule changes by issue-year and check whether those align with your chosen bins. If so, prefer the basis reflecting the old/new product rather than purely statistical fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "11) Avoid choosing by absolute AE alone — use multiple fit metrics\n",
      "- Why: AE near 1 can hide large absolute/residual variance.\n",
      "- Action: use a combination: Overall_AE closeness, WAPE, weighted RMSE, and Pearson chi-square. Only switch basis if it meaningfully reduces weighted RMSE or WAPE, not only AE.\n",
      "\n",
      "12) Implementation & governance considerations\n",
      "- Why: more bins and per-year overrides increase operational complexity.\n",
      "- Action: prefer a small number of bins unless there is strong evidence for more. Create a mapping file (Issue_Year → Basis + Scale Factor + Rationale + MinExposure). Add a review cadence (annual) and monitoring dashboard (AE by bin/plan/month) to detect drift.\n",
      "\n",
      "13) Post-selection backtesting and holdout\n",
      "- Why: to avoid overfitting.\n",
      "- Action: set aside a holdout sample (e.g., recent years or random subset) and verify out-of-sample AE for chosen bases/bins. Reassess bin choices if performance degrades.\n",
      "\n",
      "14) Consider model combination / stacking\n",
      "- Why: no single basis may fit all years/plans perfectly.\n",
      "- Action: consider combining bases with weights estimated by regression (e.g., GLM with log(Expected_i) as offsets and basis indicators) or an empirical blend where final expected = sum_j w_j * Expected_j with weights that can vary by issue-year bin. This reduces abrupt changes when switching bases.\n",
      "\n",
      "15) Practical thresholds and rules (example)\n",
      "- Only allow per-year override if:\n",
      "  - Expected amount for that year >= $X (or >= 0.5% total expected), AND\n",
      "  - The alternative basis reduces Weighted_RMSE by >= Y% (e.g., 10%) OR reduces |AE_total-1| by >= Z% (e.g., 10%), AND\n",
      "  - Improvement is seen in plan-level WAPE for the major plans (largest 80% of expected).\n",
      "- Otherwise: use default basis and a multiplicative calibration per bin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suggested next analyses I can run (pick any)\n",
      "- Produce Issue_Year-level table containing: Actual, Expected (all bases), AE, Claims, Expected exposure, standard error / CI, and a “credibility score” so you can see which years are noisy.\n",
      "- Compute plan-level and age-band residuals for the candidate bins (to check subpopulation fit).\n",
      "- Fit simple shrinkage/credibility rules and show how many year-overrides survive the credibility test.\n",
      "- Create a “decision rule” mapping (Issue_Year → Basis, Scale Factor, Exposure) ready for your pipeline.\n",
      "- Backtest the chosen mapping on a holdout period.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you tell me which business objective to prioritize (accurate total reserves; low plan-level dispersion; pricing stability; minimum operational complexity), I’ll propose a concrete decision rule and run the diagnostics to produce the final mapping and calibrated expected amounts. Which objective should I optimize for?\n"
